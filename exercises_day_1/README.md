## Day 1: Dynamic Memory Allocation and Sorting Algorithms

### Exercise 1: Dynamic Array Allocation

Create a program to allocate an array dynamically. The size of the array will be determined by user input. Fill the array with random numbers in the range 0 to 1000.

### Exercise 2: Sorting Functions

Implement two sorting functions for the array:

1. Quick Sort
2. Another sorting algorithm of your choice

### Exercise 3: Binary Search

Create a binary search function to search for elements in the sorted array.
